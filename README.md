## My Programming exam preparation ##

Okay, here's the deal - I will use this little project for preparation for the exam in Programming. I will try to implement a simple calculator in C++. The tricky part is that we need to prepare for the following topics:
* Pointers
* Data structures
* String Operations
* Polymorphism
* Recursion
* Trees
* File operations

I will try to extend the functionality of this calculator as much as possible so that I can cover all of the topics above.

This calculator has the following features:
* Basic arithmetic operations
* Fibonacci sequence
* Factorial
* Memory
* Exit

I'm unsure if we need to implement the calculator through OOP, but I will go with it as it's native for the language anyways.
